# An Enhanced MA Plot with R-Shiny to Ease Exploratory Analysis of Transcriptomic Data
![Snapshot](/SnapshotV2.png)
## Abstract
MA plots are used to analyze the genome-wide differences in gene expression between two distinct biological conditions. An MA plot is usually rendered as a static scatter plot. Our interview with 3 experts in genomics showed that we could improve the usability of this plot by adding interactive analytic features. In this work we present the design study of the enhanced MA plot.
